# web-programming-project

This project is a web application built using Flask that allows users to view stock information and historical data using the yfinance library.

Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/masalbekov-a-auca-2022/web-programming-project.git
cd web-programming-project
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/macOS
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1     # Windows PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

After running the application, you can access it in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You can search for stock tickers to view their details and historical data.


BTW  
I want to get an A for this course, I completed and submitted almost all the lab work, submitted a good quality project, I think I deserve an A.
p.s I am a semi-finalist of ICPC and was also a participant of the exchange program to America.
